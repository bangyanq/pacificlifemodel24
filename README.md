This is our UCI MS in Business Analytics Capstone project.
We are analyzing bloomberg market data, which we sourced from bloomberg terminal, then developed a model to analyze the different indicators of different asset classes to classify them and rank them.
We then integrated the financial modeling into streamlit to allow access via a webapp to create a dynamic dashboard using python and not something expensive like tableau or powerbi. 
Project team: Vincent, Casey, TJ, Bangyang, and Veronica.
